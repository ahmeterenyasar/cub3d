# cub3D Project

A 3D graphical representation using raycasting technique, inspired by the game Wolfenstein 3D.

## Usage

```bash
make
./cub3D <map.cub>
```

## Status

### To-Do 🔵
- Parse .cub file format (textures, colors, map) [IN PROGRESS]
- Implement raycasting engine
- Handle player movement and rotation
- Render walls with textures
- Add floor and ceiling colors
- Implement collision detection
- Add key event handling (WASD, arrow keys, ESC)

### Known Issues 🔴
- Most of the maps are not handled correctly. Correct maps processed as invalid most of the time. Espacially space handling needs fix.

### In Progress 🟡
- Parser implementation

### Completed 🟢
- Validation of texture files in .cub file.
